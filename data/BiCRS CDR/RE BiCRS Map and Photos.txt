Hi Alex, 

Here’s the data for the map that you are building. 

In the excel spreadsheet, you’ll see 3 sheets:
1.	Regional cost, CDR, tech (Wet) – this includes both low moisture and wet waste biomass 
technology
2.	Regional cost, CDR, tech (Dry) – this includes only low moisture biomass technology
3.	CO2 by transport mode – Amount of CO2 removed & transported by the different modes

In the first two tabs – you will see the technology chosen in each region, it’s cost and CO2 removal 
potential. 
Columns F & G represents the total CO2 removed per region and weighted cost per region for all 
technologies. 

The scenario for these data is the 2050 Zero Cropland, 90% removal target. 

We may need to consult @Baker, Sarah E. on which data we want to use, whether only low moisture 
biomass technology or both low moisture and wet waste biomass (both datas are available). 

I don’t think I’ll be able to meet this week as I’m traveling & attending a workshop in DC but will respond 
to emails if you have any questions about the data. I am available to meet next week, if needed. Let me 
know ??

Best, 
Alvina

Ya, that will work. Let’s aim for Wednesday then.

Hi Alex, 

I can try, but Monday might be a little tough. Mark has some proposal review & I’m traveling for a 
workshop next week. I can try mid of next week – hopefully that will be ok?

Best, 
Alvina

Sounds good. Can you get to me by Monday next week? I’m looking to create all these maps by the end 
of next week.

Hi Alex, 

I’m working with Mark (he’s helped us generate these maps) to get the data to you. Once, I have it, we 
can do a data walkthrough. When would you like the data by? 

Best, 
Alvina

Ah, yes, you’re right. Best to send data more representative of the bicrs chapter. Sorry for the confusion.

Hi Alex
Im confused, I thought the data were for the website/dashboard?


Alvina is very familiar with the data in the spreadsheet Wenqin sent, in case you want to walk through 
how to use it. Wenqin is sick. 

Alvina can also send data more representative of the BiCRS chapter-
The data you have are representative of the exec sum supply curve, which is a bit different than the data 
in the BiCRS chapter- because of the SAF. Also, If you wanted transportation modes for each region, I 
don’t believe we have those for the data you have. 

Up to you and Emma, just let us know what you are looking for

Sarah

I haven’t got any data since Wenqin sent this 50% SAF production data, but this might be enough. It’s for 
a high-level executive summary figure, and it has data on both technologies and feedstocks, so if this 
tells enough of the overall bicrs story, I can use this.

Hi Emma
Yes, we had a brief meeting. Alex-did Alvina and Whitney send you what you need? I can catch up again 
today too.

Hi Sarah,  
Were you and Alex able to connect? 
If you need me to join, I am available today between 10:30-11:45, 12:15-1pm, or after 2pm.

Hi Emma and Alex
I am going to propose a meeting today because I think best if I understand what data Alex needs.
 
I will check on the photos
 
Thanks!

Hi Sarah,
I hope you are well!
I am writing about a few sensitive matters with the release of the R2R report coming up. Please get 
back to us ASAP by today or tomorrow at the absolute latest!
1.       Website Map: As I've mentioned, we're putting an interactive BiCRS map on the R2R 
website (coming soon). Alex Stanley (CCed) is creating the maps on plotly.  
- Are the BiCRS maps done and can you please ensure that Alex has the up-to-date data so 
that the interactive map on the website is accurate? 
- For the interactive map, we are planning to show the 19 regions you analyzed plus: 
    -- overall co2 removal potential, cumulative by 2050, per region for BiCRS 
    -- region name 
    -- cost per metric ton of co2 removed in each region 
    -- top 5 counties for BiCRS co2 removal in each region 
    -- BiCRS EEEJ value in each region 
    -- top two BiCRS pathways/methods in each region 
- Please let me know if this looks good or you would recommend we show something else.
2.       Video: Please send over any photos/video you might have of you working in the 
lab/field! 
 
 
Thank you!
